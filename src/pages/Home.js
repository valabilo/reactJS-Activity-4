            I have told her that hers will go far.
          <br />
            'Oh, it's really not cool
            <br />
            driving this crap to school.'

            'Do I need that emotional scar? '
            <br />
            <br />
            'The kids will all laugh at the rust.
            <br />
            When we race, I'll be left in the dust! 
            <br />
            I will save up some cash
            <br />
            then we'll make a mad dash
            <br />
            to the car dealer surely you trust'.
            <br />

            'He will make us a wonderful deal
            <br />
            and I'm sure you will know how I feel.
            <br />
            I will love you so much, 
            <br />
            My siblings... I won't touch.
            <br />
            Just get me behind a new wheel'! 4

            Now she'll be cruisin in style.
            <br />
            She'll be happy for only awhile.
            <br />
            There will always be better
            <br />
            and we'll try hard to get her
            <br />
            a car that will make princess smile."
